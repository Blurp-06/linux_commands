# Linux commands for Windows

## License

These files are free to use, edit and redistribute. Honestly, I can't care less what you do with them.

## Commands

The commands I have made so far:

- touch \<filename\> \<filename2\> \<etc...\>
- cat \<filename\> \<filename2\> \<etc...\>
- ls
- pwd

## Install

Do you want to install these commands on your own system? Good news for you it is quiet easy! Install the bin folder in an easy accessible place. Now you just add the location to the bin folder to your path and the commands will be usable from everywhere through the terminal.

## Contribute

If you like to contribute and help to this project please shoot a message to my [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Blurp_06). You could also do that if you have an idea for an linux command to be converted or even a new command!
